### :globe_with_meridians: Real World Use Case

Immerse yourself in a scenario that goes beyond the lines of code. This challenge is carefully crafted to reflect the intricacies and dynamism of social media connections in the real world.

### :dart: Objective

Your task is to develop common connection features found in social media platforms.

#### :story: User Stories

- **Suggestions:** Clicking on "Suggestions" should display users not yet connected, whom you haven't invited, and who haven't sent you an invitation.

- **Connect:** Clicking on "Connect" should send a connection request to the selected user.

- **Sent Requests:** View all connection requests you've sent.

- **Withdraw Request:** Withdraw a connection request you've sent.

- **Received Requests:** View all connection requests sent to you.

- **Accept:** Accept a connection request and add the user to your network.

- **Connections:** View all your connections.

- **Remove Connection:** Remove a user from your network.

- **Connections in Common:** View all connections in common with a selected user.

#### :bulb: Additional Requirements

- Only 10 entries should be shown at the beginning. Clicking "Load more" should load 10 more entries at a time. Once there are no more entries, the "Load more" button should disappear. This applies to "Connections", "Sent Requests", "Received Requests", "Connections" as well as "Connections in common".
- The brackets should always contain the total number of the respective categories.
- To test all of the above, include seeders and factories to generate suggestions, requests by other users and connections in common with the command:
       
    DatabaseSeeder.php
    ```php artisan migrate --seed```. Connections could then be tested by accepting a request.

    ```
    <?php

    namespace Database\Seeders;

    use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
    use Database\Seeders\UsersSeeder;
    use Database\Seeders\RequestsSeeder;
    use Database\Seeders\ConnectionsInCommonSeeder;
    use Illuminate\Database\Console\Seeds\WithoutModelEvents;

    class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder
    {
        /**
         * Seed the application's database.
         *
         * @return void 
         */
        public function run()
        {
            $this->call(UsersSeeder::class);
            $this->call(RequestsSeeder::class);
            $this->call(ConnectionsInCommonSeeder::class);
        }
    }    
    
    ```
  
- If there are no connections in common, the button should get the class 'disabled'.
- All new routes should be written into a new routing file (e.g. userConnection.php), that must be registered inside the RouteServiceProvider.php file.
- There are blade components such as connection, request and so on. You can use all of them or decide to only use one component with if clauses.
- Before each ajax call (only for getting suggestions, request and connections), show the loading skeletons and hide them after a successful response from the server.
- Javascript code should be written in their respective files and included in the main.js file.

## :computer: Coding and Naming Conventions

- Follow the [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standard.
- Name HTML ids in snake_case.
- Javascript & PHP variables in camelCase.
- Make sure that your code is readable for others and include comments in important places. (Guideline: Code = How?, Comment = What?)
